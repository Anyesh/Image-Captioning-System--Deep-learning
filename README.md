Automatic Image captioning is one of the most recent problem that caught interest of computer vision community and Natural Language Processing communities alike. This is major part of scene understanding in computer vision. Not one only do we have to recognize objects in the image, but we have to find relationships in natural language. This project addresses the problem by using a deep neural network model. The model would make use of Convolution neural networks to read image data and Recurrent neural networks for learning sentences/captions for image. There are various open datasets like Flickr8K, Flickr30K, MSCOCO that can be used to train the model.
